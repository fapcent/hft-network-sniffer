# 🕸️ HFT Network Sniffer (Kernel Bypass)



A low-level network analysis tool designed to monitor TCP/IP traffic latency and micro-bursts without standard library overhead.



## 🚀 Key Features

* **Raw Sockets:** Direct interaction with the Network Interface Card (NIC), bypassing high-level abstractions.

* **Packet Parsing:** Manual decoding of Ethernet, IP, and TCP headers (Binary struct unpacking).

* **Micro-burst Detection:** Real-time identification of bandwidth saturation spikes.



## 🛠 Stack

* **Language:** Python (struct, socket)

* **Concepts:** TCP/IP Stack, Endianness, Buffer management

* **Ops:** Docker (Host Networking mode)
